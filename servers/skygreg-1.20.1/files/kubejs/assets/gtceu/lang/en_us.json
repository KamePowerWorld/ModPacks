    "sg.lv_age.quests29.description1": "Take your time - With an exception for the Steam age, don't rush through progression. If you do you are going to suffer from lack of infrastructure and automation. Once you get to the LV age you should start looking into automating as much as you can with AE2. Being able to request Circuits from your Terminal is going to be a game changer. As you progress into higher ages you should be looking to replace your autocrafting machines with higher tier machines to double the speed.",
    "sg.lv_age.quests29.description2": "Amps - How many channels of energy a Wire or Cable can carry. A single block machine will either generate or use 1 amp of energy. The easiest way around this is the use a Battery Buffer. The 4x means to Battery Buffer can hold 4 Batteries. A Battery Buffer will send out the same amount of amps as the amount of filled Batteries it contains, meaning a filled 4x Battery Buffer will send out 4 amps, even if you only have 2 generators. You will need Cables to match the amperage or else the Cables will burn up.",
    "sg.lv_age.quests29.description3": "Energy tiers - GregTech is devided into energy tiers. You start in the Steam age with no energy, however Steam will still be how you produce energy for now. As you progress through tiers something important to note is that you will start going through fuels 4 times faster as you are generating 4 times the energy. Machines will operate 2 times faster. Steam will hold up to the LV and MV age quite well but every couple tiers you increase you will want to look for a better fuel option. For instance when I reached the HV age the Steam consumption rate was just too much so I looked into Oil processing for Diesel to use in Combustion Generators.",

A lot of recipes will take 30 EU/t where an LV Steam Turbine only produces 32 EU/t. Just give the 1 machine a dedicated generator to make sure it will always run, especially for certain autocrafting setups that cannot afford to stop. Now obviously if you have 4 machines that all need 4EU/t then a Cable setup is ideal.",
    "sg.lv_age.quests29.description5": "Energy loss per block - Wires and Cables have an energy loss per block. This is mostly an issue in the earlier ages as losing 1 eu per block is quite damaging with not much eu to spare. In later ages you will be able to span greater distances with Cables because the EU/t being generated is usually much more than the EU/t required by machines. There are also \\\"Superconductor Cables\\\", 1 for each energy tier, which do not lose any energy per block. They are quite expensive but very worth it in certain situations. You should always be trying to craft the Cables for you energy tier with the lowest loss per block that you can afford.",
